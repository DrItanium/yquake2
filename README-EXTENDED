I found out about yquake2 today (11/29/2012) and I absolutely love it
(widescreen support, etc). I forked the code base so that I could add an expert
system to it as a way to test the viability of an expert system within a video
game. 

Obviously, the expert system tool I'm going to use is CLIPS but I have no idea
what I'm going to do at this point. Only it will be an interesting experiment.

My original idea was to see if it was possible to swap out the AI system with
the expert system so that I could add extra functionality. However, at this
point I'm probably going to test out how one uses multiple environments and
modules instead. 

It looks like I may need to provide each entity with it's own environment so
that internal operations can occur within it. There will be a global
environment as well as any gestalt environments used to allow cross
communication between two or more entities.
